# What is Aleph?

**Aleph** is an open-source off-chain P2P (peer-to-peer) **network** featuring a **decentralized database** (inc. file storage), **computing**, and a **DID framework**. Aleph allows your blockchain-enabled app (dApp) to securely access trusted off-chain data or computation through cross-chain connectivity and our javascript client library.\

### Why use Aleph.im?

To build dApps without centralized components. Data storage and business logic run on Aleph's unstoppable decentralized network instead of a centralized service such as AWS or Google Cloud.

This is the **first generation of fully decentralized apps**.
